# Deep-Learning-based-Cell-Segmentation-for-Automatic-Neuron-Injection
Code for Deep-Learning based Cell Segmentation for Automatic Neuron Injection 

[ Environment configuration ]

-python 3.7.10

-tensorflow 2.3.0

-numpy 1.20.2

-scipy 1.6.2

[ File ] Data4Mask.py and attUNet4Mask.py
These two files are mainly used for the training phase of the model. One is a training data generator and the other is a model structure based on Keras implementation.

[ File ] CellSegmentation.py
This file mainly gives examples of applying the model to predict images.
